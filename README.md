# Introduction

Exploratory work looking at encoding an English translation of 
an Irish Exchequer receipt roll (TNA, E 101/233/16) as TEI/XML 
and extracting financial information programmatically.

The first membrane was of the roll was marked up manually 
([E_101_233_16.xml](E_101_233_16.xml)) 
and queried by [values.query](values.query) (via the Oxygen XML editor) to 
create a csv file ([results.csv](results.csv)).

The [notebook](overview.ipynb) has some tables and graphs.
